All engines (Edge-TTS, Piper, XTTS, Qwen3, ...) implement the `TTSEngine`
interface so the rest of the app can switch between them without knowing
the details of any single engine.

Heavy engines (XTTS, Qwen3, ...) are expected to do lazy imports inside
their modules so that app startup stays fast even when torch or CUDA is
installed.
